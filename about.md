Hi, I am [Jack Sun (孙伟)](http://www.jkcrazy.net). I graduate from the
[Department of Computer Science & Engineering](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn) at
[Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://www.sjtu.edu.cn).
My research area is data processing and knowledge discovering. My advisor is
[Kenny Q. Zhu](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~kzhu/).


I am a curious guy and always would like to taste cutting-edge, cool things, including
both technology and hobbies.


In the past few academic years, through various kind of
project or internship, I've tried many kind of techs, languages and tools,
such as Struts, Spring, Java, Python, jQuery, NodeJS, etc.


Recently, I'm also fascinated by photography. After all these years, I find the life is
passing away so quickly and quietly. So I am eager to use my camera to frozen those
remarkable and precious time. You can view my lofter at
